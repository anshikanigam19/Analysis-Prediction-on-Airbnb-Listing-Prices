With the growing popularity of Airbnb as a platform for short-term rentals, understanding the pricing dynamics is crucial for hosts and potential investors. This project explores various aspects of Airbnb listing data to identify key price determinants and develop a model to predict listing prices.

Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Inside Airbnb, which provides detailed information on listings, including attributes such as location, room type, amenities, number of reviews, and more.

Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting data appropriately for analysis. Steps include:

Removing irrelevant columns

Filling or removing missing values

Converting data types

Handling outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the distribution and relationships between different features in the dataset. Key activities include:

Summary statistics

Visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.)

Correlation analysis

Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. Techniques used:

Encoding categorical variables

Creating interaction terms

Normalizing numerical features

Modeling

Several machine learning models are implemented and compared, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

XGBoost

The models are trained using cross-validation to ensure robustness and to prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on their performance metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared

Comparisons are made to determine the best-performing model.

Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of findings from the data analysis and the performance of the predictive models. Insights into the most influential factors affecting Airbnb listing prices are discussed.

Future Work

Potential improvements and extensions of the project include:

Incorporating additional data sources (e.g., neighborhood crime rates, local events)

Implementing more advanced machine learning techniques

Building a web application for real-time price predictions
